# Home sensors project

## Sensor list

- DHT22: temperature/humidity
- BPM180: temperature/pressure/altitude

## Results so far

- DHT22 seems to be accurate on temperature (checked with other tools)
- BPM180 seems to be underestimating values, all three seems to be below the expected/actual values
